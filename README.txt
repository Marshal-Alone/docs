Collaborative Whiteboard Docs Viewer
====================================

This is a static website for viewing the following documents:
- architecture_diagrams.txt
- ppt_script.md
- technical_details.md

How to use:
-----------
1. Place all files (index.html, style.css, app.js, and the three docs) in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in your web browser.

If you see errors loading the documents, your browser may block local file fetches for security reasons. In that case, run a simple local server:

For Python 3:
    python -m http.server 8000

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

No build or installation is required.
